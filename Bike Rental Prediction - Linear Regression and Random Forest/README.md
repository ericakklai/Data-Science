# Bike-Rental Prediction by Linear Regression and Random Forest


• The goal of this project is to to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. Under the Capital Bikeshare program, people can rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place. The process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city.
 
• Specifically, the aims of this project is utilize historical usage patterns of Bike sharing system as well as weather data to forecast bike rental demand. The data were generated by the Bike sharing systems in which the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Specifically, the dataset consists of hourly rental data spanning two years. The actual source of data set is from Kaggle (www.kaggle.com) which provided the data as the material for a competition.


• Methodology: In this project, 3 kinds of models/algorithms would be considered. i.e. Simple Model, Linear Regression and Random forests.
