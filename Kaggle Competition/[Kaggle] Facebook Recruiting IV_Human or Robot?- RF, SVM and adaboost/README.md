### Kaggle project 
*[Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Robot?]

[Facebook Recruiting IV: Human or Robot?]:<https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iv-human-or-bot>

###Abstract:

Why do you always fail in an online auction? An increasing num- ber of robots used in the online bidding makes it more difficult for
a human to land a winning bid. Based on the data sets provided
by Kaggle, we implemented three classification algorithms trying
to separate the bids from human and robots. In first section, a fea- ture engineering method is stated to select the useful features. In the following three sections, we introduce the algorithm, discuss the fea- tures and parameters we are using and show the final performances of each algorithms.

###Algorithms:

1. Random Forests
2. SVM
3. Adaboost

###Result:

Three algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Adaboost are applied in this classification project and all of them per- formed an over 80% accuracy on the test data set. Random Forest returns the highest accuracy of 94.227% which outperforms most of the submis- sions.

###Final Ranking on Kaggle

Our submission has a final ranking of 2 (post-deadline entry).
