# Cancer Class Prediction by multinomial regression model with lasso

• Data Description 
*[Data Description]

[Data Description]:<http://bioinformatics.rutgers.edu/Supplements/CompCancer/>


• Number of dataset : 35 

• Methodology
For each dataset, I use a multinomial regression model with the lasso to predict the relevant classes. 
Besides, I used cross-validation to assess model accuracy and report the misclassification error rate. 

For each best model, the number of genes used is also recorded.
