### Summary of Analysis
• Use glmnet to produce Linear/ Logistic regression regularized by L1 (Lasso Regression), L2 (Ridge Regression) and Elastic Net
• Estimate the regularization coefficient that produces the minimum error
• Study and Compare the number of features selected under each of the regularization scheme
