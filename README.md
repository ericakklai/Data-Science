* [Human or Robot?] - RF, SVM and adaboost
* [Springleaf Marketing Response] - Random Forest and xgboost
* [Image Recognition] - Convolution Neural Network by tensorflow
* [Simulation on the Sample Binary Matrices with Fixed Marginals] - Efficient MCMC Algorithm
* [Data Segmentation] - Clustering Algorithm DBScan
* [Image Segmentation] -EM Clustering
* [Document Title Mining] - Frequent Pattern 
* [Model Comparison] - SVM vs NaiveBayes Classifier
